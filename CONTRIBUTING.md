# How to contribute

## Gitflow: 
https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow
```
A develop branch is created from main
A release branch is created from develop
Feature branches are created from develop
When a feature is complete it is merged into the develop branch
When the release branch is done it is merged into develop and main
If an issue in main is detected a hotfix branch is created from main
Once the hotfix is complete it is merged to both develop and main
```
